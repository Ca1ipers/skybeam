title: Insomnia
---
Garbled and jumbled sounds blast in my mind. <br>
As soon as I get myself situated in bed this happens. <br>
A combination of events, thoughts, memories, and noise overflow in my brain. <br>
Attempts to sleep are like filling an already full balloon. <br>
I feel like I'm going to burst.

It's been 3 hours now. <br>
Nothing has changed. <br>
Even if I get up and decide to stay awake, <br>
I just mindlessly switch between the same 3 websites I always go to. <br>
And the noise is still there.

I pray that eventually I tire myself out. <br>
But for now I keep writing poems. <br>
As this is just another one of my many problems. <br>
Problems that people probably wouldn't know about. <br>
Nor care to be honest.
