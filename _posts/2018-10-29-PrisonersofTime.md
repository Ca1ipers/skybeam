title: Prisoners of Time
---

We are all prisoners of time. <br>
Time tells you when. <br>
When to wake up. <br>
When to sleep. <br>
When to work.

If you're not ready, it will move on without you. <br>
Time doesn't rely on anything. <br>
It waits for no one. <br>
An unstoppable force, <br>
with only one direction.

Forward.

Even if you resist the changes, <br>
time will shove you. <br>
It has no feelings. <br>
It cannot give you mercy. <br>
Time controls us all. <br>
Time controls the universe. <br>
Time controls death.
