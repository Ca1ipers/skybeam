title: Another me
---

You scream in my ears like I can’t hear. <br>
I know it’s coming near.<br>
It’s never been clearer.

I collect the dreams I threw away.<br>
A vision of the past starts to play.<br>
It’s me in the mirror.

My hand bashes the glass, covering me in shards and blood.<br>
Wanting to hurt the past, forgetting that it's me.<br>
It's not me.

I hate that the days cycle by with no tick.<br>
My mind spins with the hands of the clocks around me.<br>
It’s another me everywhere I look.

Screens, glass, water, and all things reflective.<br>
I stare and stare and stare and stare and stare.<br>
Its soulless eyes cry for help.

The meaning fades when it’s all just me.<br>
The reflections distort and waver.<br>
Its eyes are mine.

Downcast days clear up, but even then I get burned by the sun.
