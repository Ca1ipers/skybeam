Every step I take there is a leaf. <br>
It lets out a crisp crunch. <br>
I like to watch as they <br>
Twirl <br>
Drift <br>
And Land <br>
Right beneath my feet. <br>

The leaf has gone through its cycle. <br>
It has done all it can. <br>
But it does one last thing. <br>
Crunch. <br>

My feet move as fast as the leaf came down, <br>
On to the next, <br>
And the next, <br>
And the next. <br>
Until there is no more. <br>
I am on my own now. <br>
Thank you leaves. <br>
