title: Sad.
---
The words come out of my mouth, but it does not feel good. <br>
They spill out like vomit, burning the back of my throat with its acidity. <br>
I fall back, my arms and legs shaking, staring at the mess I’ve made. <br>
An entanglement of lines, curves, and shapes, what used to be letters.

The puddle of lexicons meld with the room around me. <br>
Darkness enshrouded the room as the words create a cage. <br>
Tripping, falling, crawling, clawing towards the window, I try. <br>
But would escaping this horror even be salvation?

It’s a strange question to ask at a time like this. <br>
What’s even stranger is the comfort of a mess. <br>
A chaotic but organized dissonance of randomness. <br>
Redundant redundancy with repetition.

I peer through the window as it too, is concealed by the cacophony of characters. <br>
Why is it that I even write these poems, let alone doing anything in this world? <br>
I don’t even think that usage of “let alone” is grammatically correct. <br>
But in the end, isn’t my mindset that nothing matters anyways?

I’m sad.
