I walk up to the TV. <br>
Another tape in hand, I switch them out. <br>
I replay the same films over and over again, <br>
hoping to discover something new, <br>
torturing myself again and again. <br>

The facts have already been laid out. <br>
Nothing will change. <br>
What exactly am I looking for? <br>

My head spins. <br>
The tapes unravel. <br>
My sanity goes under. <br>
The walls fade and crumble. <br>
The tapes replay the most agonizing parts, <br>
over and, <br>
over and, <br>
OVER. <br>
AGAIN. <br>

My brain's wrinkles unravel and tangle, <br>
blood seeps out from under my nails. <br>
I'm not in control. <br>
The floor dissolves into the void. <br>
And I do too. <br>
