What can I say that hasn’t been said better?
What can I do that hasn’t been done better?
Just a mess of words and emotions.
Even stacked nicely, it would crumble.

What can I feel that isn’t sadness?
What can I think that isn’t suicide?
Just a body on the floor.
Even cared for, it would rot.

The world spins and so does my head.
Just a narcissistic autistic.
Is the attention never enough for you?

The time passes and so does my life.
My federal rights, so ephemeral.
What else is there to take?

An itching pulse scratches at my wrists.
All the times I was curious, it amounts to this.

It gets closer, closer, closer, but nothing comes.
Just a few scratches and marks.

The flood of red is contained for now.

Too afraid to die, but too cowardly to live.
