What can I say that hasn’t been said better? <br>
What can I do that hasn’t been done better? <br>
Just a mess of words and emotions. <br>
Even stacked nicely, it would crumble.

What can I feel that isn’t sadness? <br>
What can I think that isn’t suicide? <br>
Just a body on the floor. <br>
Even cared for, it would rot.

The world spins and so does my head. <br>
Just a narcissistic autistic. <br>
Is the attention never enough for you?

The time passes and so does my life. <br>
My federal rights, so ephemeral. <br>
What else is there to take?

An itching pulse scratches at my wrists. <br>
All the times I was curious, it amounts to this. <br>

It gets closer, closer, closer, but nothing comes. <br>
Just a few scratches and marks.

The flood of red is contained for now.

Too afraid to die, but too cowardly to live.
