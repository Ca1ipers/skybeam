title: Gone
---
It feels like there are pieces missing of an infinitely large puzzle. <br>
Of course I can never expect it to be completely complete. <br>
There will always be some gaps in a puzzle this big. <br>
But there are more pieces missing than usual.

It’s not right.

Large sections of the puzzle are now disconnected. <br>
Many pieces are also in the wrong places. <br>
Some are connecting where they shouldn’t even be able. <br>
A large part of the puzzle I expected to be there is now gone.

I can feel that it’s gone.

There has been a severe shift in my mindset. <br>
The same drive that has always been there has disappeared. <br>
The same optimism that has always been there has dissipated. <br>
The same heart that has always been there has disintegrated.

It feels empty.

My love for my favorite things is just ambivalence now. <br>
The optimist view I had for things is just realism now. <br>
Inside me, the fire that I had for things is just ashes now. <br>
Things just aren’t the same anymore.
