Everyday the same feelings take over. <br>
Why did you do that?<br>
Regret.<br>
Why didn't you do that?<br>
Guilt.<br>
The happiness is temporary.<br>
Depression.<br>
What if you aren't good enough?<br>
Anxiety.<br>
Everything is hard and life isn't worth living.<br>
Suicide.<br>
No one is really your friend.<br>
Loneliness.<br>
Those people only talk to you because they have to.<br>
Doubt.<br>
No matter how happy I am,<br>
No matter how good things are going,<br>
No matter anything.<br>
It's always the same.<br>
The feelings take over,<br>
and I can never be truly happy.
