title: I shouldn't be jealous.
layout: post

You’re so insecure. <br>
Self deprecation in front of others. <br>
They feel the need to reassure you. <br>
They’re all focused on you.

I mask it well so I guess it doesn’t matter. <br>
I mask it well so you don’t have to worry. <br>
I mask it well I hope.

Or maybe I don’t. <br>
Maybe I wish I could crash out at people. <br>
Maybe I wish I could get some comfort.

Is this bad? <br>
Is this jealousy? <br>
Is this just longing for something I don’t have?

I think of disappearing, but I get too scared. <br>
I have nothing and everything to lose. <br>
Maybe it’d be nice to lose it all. <br>
Not like they’re looking at me anyways. <br>
Then I’d have a reason to close the book. <br>
Make this my final chapter.
