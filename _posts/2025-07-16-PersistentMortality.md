title: Persistant Mortality
---

Every year that passes by, my future comes to thought.<br>
How many battles have I ever fought?<br>
All that work and it might be all for naught.<br>
More time to live can’t just be bought.

Every month that passes by, my adulthood is on the spot.<br>
How do I do these forms I’ve never been taught?<br>
I can never remember even with the notes I jot.<br>
There’s only so much time you can allot.

Every week that passes by, feels like time just flew.<br>
How much more time do I have left with you?<br>
There’s so many things about you I never knew.<br>
And things we will never be able to do.

Every day that passes by, your mortality comes into view.<br>
How much longer can we really rely on you?<br>
You say you’re not old, but I can see it's not true.<br>
And when you finally die, I might just follow too.
