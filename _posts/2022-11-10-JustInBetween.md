title: Just In Between
---

Not really here or there. <br>
Just bouncing in between. <br>
Everyone has their own thing. <br>
That I’m not a part of. <br>

Some of them have friends. <br>
Some of them have no time. <br>
Some of them have their own. <br>

No matter how many clubs I join <br>
Or friends I make, <br>
It's always a flip of a coin. <br>

On whether or not they’re busy, <br>
Or whether or not they’re already playing with friends, <br>
Or whether or not they even talk to me. <br>

I’ve always been on my own, <br>
As soon as I think I have a group, <br>
With the wind it is blown. <br>

I thought I’d get used to it by now, <br>
I thought the pain would ease off somehow. <br>
I thought maybe I should take a bow. <br>

Take a bow and get used to the solitude. <br>
Shouldn’t be having an attitude. <br>
I'm not that important. <br>
