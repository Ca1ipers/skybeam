title: Disappearance

“See you tomorrow!” “Catch you later!” <br>
I don’t know how much longer these phrases will remain true. <br>
I’ll disappear one day, and the memories of me will be dyed a deep red.

Everyday, I stroll slowly, staring into space. <br>
I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this. <br>
I’ll disappear one day, and the dawns and dusks will still be a bright orange.

My eyes burn from the screen in front of me. <br>
I don’t know how much more I can take. <br>
I’ll disappear one day, and the world will still bask in sunshine yellow.

When the trees are at their greenest, and the leaves sway gently, <br>
When the skies are all blue, and the clouds all go away, <br>
When the flowers are blooming indigo, and their petals all show, <br>
When the nights are glowing purple, and the stars start to shine,

Will I still be here?

Will you still be by my side?

Because even if a rose’s petals fall, it's still a flower right? <br>
Because even if a season ends, its memories are still cherished right? <br>
Because even if a poem’s words jumble, it’s still a poem right? <br>
Because even if a photo is lost, it’s still fondly remembered right?

Even if I don’t believe it, I want it to be true.
