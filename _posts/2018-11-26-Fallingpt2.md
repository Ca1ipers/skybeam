title: Falling pt.2
---

I used to have people to catch me. <br>
To catch me when I fell, <br>
and to put me back up. <br>
They would hold on for however long I needed. <br>
Now they're gone. <br>

There are people who could catch me, <br>
but I don't know who to trust. <br>
They might hold on for a while, <br>
but leave me after a while. <br>
They might not hold me at all, <br>
and just let me fall. <br>

Everynow and then, there would be a floor to rest on. <br>
I could relax for however long I needed. <br>
That's gone too. <br>

The last floor I've seen was months ago. <br>
Falling, I reminisce on these topics. <br>
Will someone catch me eventually? <br>
Will a floor appear beneath me? <br>
Or will I fall into the void? <br>
the emptiness. <br>
the end. <br>
