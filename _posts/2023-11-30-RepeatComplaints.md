title: Repeat Complaints
---

Lie on the floor. <br>
Lie on the floor. <br>
Lie on the floor. <br>
Don’t answer the door.

Look at your phone. <br>
Look at your phone. <br>
Look at your phone. <br>
Your presence isn’t known.

Scratch your arm. <br>
Scratch your arm. <br>
Scratch your arm. <br>
The hair will never leave.

I scream and slam my hand on the table. <br>
Exam after exam after exam after exam. <br>
Im scraping my arms harder than I am scraping by. <br>
But I’m not really scraping by am I? <br>
I’m not on the verge of failing. <br>
What’s there to complain about? <br>
Stop complaining. <br>
Shut the fuck up.
