Some constant thoughts. <br>
Why? <br>
Why are you depressed? <br>
When? <br>
When will you be useful? <br>
The answer is always the same, yet they repeat. <br>
Go away. <br>
Leave me alone, let me rest. <br>
I just don’t know, alright? <br>
I don’t know. <br>
Your constant berating doesn’t help. <br>
Yet they, and several others bash my head. <br>
Sitting next to the window, I ponder my life. <br>
I should have, would have, could have. <br>
What I wish does not matter, nothing will change. <br>
I sob silently. <br>
No more. <br>
Crying to sleep. <br>
My life has not been full of problems. <br>
Yet the rain begins. <br>
A constant cycle of bad ideas. <br>
Do it. <br>
I will never, I must live. <br>
A sudden energy burst. <br>
Bad thoughts repeat. <br>
Infinitely like pi. <br>
They go on forever but so will I.  <br>
