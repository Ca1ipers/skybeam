A break that I won’t forget. <br>
A break that I won’t ever get.<br>
From now on,<br>
Life stampedes ahead.

A job that was my first.<br>
A job that almost made me burst.<br>
From now on,<br>
Life is filled with dread.

A place that I have loved.<br>
A place that I must leave.<br>
From now on,<br>
Life separates our threads.

I’d like to hold your hand forever.<br>
I’d like to stay and do whatever.<br>
But I must let go.

When I let go, you won’t fade into the past.<br>
When I let go, you won’t rot in the present.<br>
When I let go, you will travel to the future.<br>
When I let go, I will remember you.
