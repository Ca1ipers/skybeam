title: Nothing, nowhere.
---

I'm tired and I want to go home. <br>
But I can’t sleep in my own bed. <br>
My stomach keeps churning. <br>
While the world outside is burning. <br>
Where would I even go?

Remember to look both ways when crossing the road <br>
To the past it's full of regret and to the future all is bleak. <br>
But I could look both ways and it’d still run me over. <br>
Or at least I wish it would, because then I'd get some closure. <br>
Instead it just whizzes by constantly never letting me through.

All my questions have been answered, but not with ones I like. <br>
There is nothing more for me. <br>
There is nothing I can do. <br>
There is nowhere to go. <br>
I have seen everything that I needed.

I don’t care about the things I used to <br>
But I care about the things I don't really need to. <br>
I wish I didn’t care about the thoughts that come through. <br>
Because one day I might agree. <br>
But then after that it won’t be my problem.
