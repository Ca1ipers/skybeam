title: Freedom of Finality
---

Does anything matter? <br>
I’m mad like a hatter,<br>
I just get more sadder,<br>
I can’t find the pattern,

Of happiness in life,<br>
My mind is filled with strife,<br>
Cut my neck with a knife,<br>
Sent to the afterlife.

After life there is death.<br>
I take my final breath.

Every night I slept,<br>
Every tear I wept,<br>
Every promise I kept,

All of them broken.<br>
Not one final word spoken.<br>
Take this poem as a token.

A token to remember me.
