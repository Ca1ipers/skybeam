title: Nothing left.
---
There's nothing left to say but my fingers keep typing. <br>
No tears left to cry but I keep wiping. <br>
Clench my teeth, heart rate spiking.

Can’t take much of this anymore. <br>
Every way I look It’s a dead end. <br>
I’ll pour my guts out on the store floor, <br>
Create a scene no one could comprehend.

How many times can I rewrite that I wanna die? <br>
Even with all this love, I keep thinking they’re lies. <br>
Even with all this love, my heart cries.

Talked so much we ran out of topics, <br>
Now the only thing left is for me to say goodbye. <br>
Or resort to narcotics, be one with alcoholics, <br>
Live life in the streets, begging just to get by.

Why is it that it’s never enough for me? <br>
Give me everything and I’d still feel lonely. <br>
Give me everything and I’d still feel crappy.

Feels like these feelings will last for eternity. <br>
I could throw them in a book or speak them all out, <br>
But internally they brew uncertainty purposely. <br>
Those thoughts will again sprout.

There’s nothing left for me but I keep on going. <br>
I wanna stop but the river keeps flowing. <br>
All these feelings, but they just keep growing, <br>
I’m cold as hell, but it keeps snowing <br>
My steps slowing, <br>
I’m honing in <br>
On a solution.

You already know what it is.
