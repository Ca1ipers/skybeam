title: Is it okay?
---

Is it okay if I give up here?<br>
Here, where I’ve spent all my time.<br>
My time, which I’ve wasted day after day.<br>
Day after day, I always feel the same.<br>
The same way I’ve always felt.<br>
I felt depressed.

Is it okay if I be annoying?<br>
Annoying you to play some games.<br>
Some games I’ve always wanted to play.<br>
To play with you because I can’t bear to be alone.<br>
Be alone is what I do too often.<br>
Too often I think bad thoughts.

Is it okay if I tell you what I really think?<br>
I really think you should let go.<br>
Let go of them and go back.<br>
Go back to times when we would play.<br>
Play together night after night.<br>
Night after night I stare and I cry.

Is it okay if I go up there?<br>
There to the tops of buildings.<br>
Buildings that are tall, near the stars.<br>
The stars, they shine bright tonight.<br>
Tonight I went up to the parking deck.

Is it okay if I drop right down?
