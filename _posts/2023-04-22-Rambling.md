Going with the flow. <br>
Riding through the snow. <br>
Taking it slow. <br>
Making it grow. <br>
Doing a show. <br>
Cuz you don’t know. <br>

What’s really going on <br>
Since I'm inside of my head <br>
Getting ahead of myself <br>
My selfish needs <br>
Never appeased <br>
Onto the next one. <br>

Where the next one is I’m not. <br>
Because I’d know where I was if I knew where I wasn’t <br>
And that's where the next one is. <br>
I’m not there because I’m here <br>
I’m not him because I’m me <br>
I’ll always be. <br>

Just a step behind my own footprints. <br>
My foot, printing a path that I don’t follow. <br>
Going with it but it feels hollow. <br>
Wish it would just give me a minute. <br>
Cuz my head is just not in it.

In it to win it but I only lose big <br>
Big loss, sunk cost fallacy <br>
It's all I see in me. <br>
Bin me, cuz im just a negative ROI. <br>

Self depreciation, self deprecation <br>
It’s all I know, it's all I’ve been. <br>
Even though I know better

I am better now. <br>
But as you know. <br>

It never really goes away. <br>
