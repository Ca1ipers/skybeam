Every second I lay here, the clock yet again ticks. <br>
Staring into space, wishing my thoughts would come to life. <br>
Hours pass by, I don’t move.

By now, all I remember is that I forgot. <br>
Forget me, and I’ll disappear. <br>
Disappear into the sea of memories.

The frigid air scrapes my throat every breath I take. <br>
My arms tremble, eyes wide open, watching. <br>
Witnessing my spiral downwards.

If you’re still here somewhere, don’t bother. <br>
If you’re still with me somehow, don’t stay. <br>
If you’re still holding on, just let go.

Another black out, now I stand at the edge. <br>
A dark forest, another painful adventure. <br>
There’s nothing else for me here.

I wander into the depths of nature, aimless. <br>
Surrounding me, years of destruction, blameless. <br>
To everyone around me, I am nameless.
