It's been rainy recently. <br>
Drips, drops, drizzles, and drenched. <br>
I watch as the world outside turns a pale grey. <br>
The pitter patter pattern of the rain hits my window. <br>

I stay where it is warm and dry. <br>
The rain is nice, but to be in it? <br>
It would spell the start of goodbye. <br>

Getting wet isn’t nice. <br>
Squish, squelch, squash, everywhere I step. <br>
It starts to drag me down. <br>
Damp, dark, and dull, but the world goes on. <br>

I don’t want to be in the rain. <br>
The downpour starts. <br>
I don’t want to be in pain. <br>

The rain is not what drowns you. <br>
It is the flood that comes after. <br>
