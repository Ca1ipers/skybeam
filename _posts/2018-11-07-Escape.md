title: Escape
---

There is none.

Not from school, <br>
not from chores, <br>
not from life.

Everyday there's more work to do. <br>
Homework to finish, <br>
things to clean, <br>
people to think about.

A constant flow of work, <br>
and a monotonous daily routine. <br>
It drains all emotions and energy.

I want to escape but 3 guns touch my head. <br>
Guilt. <br>
Depression. <br>
Anxiety.

The emotional damage is too much. <br>
I have to keep going. <br>
But not out of determination, <br>
it's because there is nowhere to go. <br>
No escape.
