title: Thoughts that come back
---

I’m sorry for lying to you. <br>
I can’t say it anymore. <br>
I wanted to believe it. <br>
But the feelings come back. <br>
And so do the thoughts.

It feels like with <br>
Every recommendation. <br>
Every mechanism. <br>
Every tip and trick. <br>
It feels like nothing has changed.

I’m sorry that I feel this way. <br>
I can’t say it anymore. <br>
I wanted to get better. <br>
But the feelings come back. <br>
And so do the thoughts.

Where do I even go from here? <br>
Is it my fault? <br>
Is there something more I should’ve done? <br>
Is there something wrong I did? <br>
What do I even do from here?

I’m sorry that I’m so depressed. <br>
I can’t say that I won’t kill myself. <br>
I wanted to try so, so hard. <br>
But the feelings came back. <br>
And so did the thoughts.
