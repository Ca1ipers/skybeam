title: Ambivalence and Aimlessness
---

There’s nothing I want and nowhere to go. <br>
There’s no place to be, and nothing to show. <br>
My answer is just always “I don’t know.”

There are feelings that I just can’t derive. <br>
There are thoughts that just don’t arrive. <br>
My answer is just always “I don’t want to be alive.”

My hobbies and passions are all burnt out. <br>
All the info and facts that I used to know about. <br>
I used to enjoy them, I used to care. <br>
Ambivalence has taken over me, leaving me bare.

My education and degree, thrown to the side. <br>
All the grades and scores, I used to have pride. <br>
I used to be proud, I used to be joyed. <br>
Aimlessness has taken over me, leaving a void.

It’s not that I don’t care, or want, or love these things. <br>
It’s just that it feels like I’m not the one pulling the strings.

I want to care, and want, and love these things. <br>
The same way others do about me.

The pattern ends here.
