title: The last day of good sleep
---

I wanna be frozen in time. <br>
I wanna sulk silently and stay in my room. <br>
I wanna push these feelings down deep <br>
So deep that I’d forget. <br>
Forget everything I’ve ever been through.

My analyzations have been thorough <br>
There must be something else though <br>
At least that's what I thought. <br>
It’s too tough.

Screaming in pain with no lungs to breathe. <br>
Drowning in liquids, origin unknown. <br>
Choking, I can’t breathe.

Freeze me. Cryogenically. <br>
Let me sleep forever so I never have to wake up.

It’s not that bad. I just don’t want to face it.
