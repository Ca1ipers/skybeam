title: Falling
---

I climb. <br> 
I climb on ladders, <br>
on rocks, <br>
on stairs, <br>
on vines,

on everything.

Higher and higher upwards. <br>
It's a long way to the top, <br>
but I keep going. <br>
Things fall from above, <br>
things pull down from below. <br>
I force myself to continue.

After years of climbing, <br>
I let go. <br>
Falling. <br>
Down into the dark abyss of nothingness.

Why did I let go? <br>
I don't know. <br>
It's a long way down. <br>
I let all the forces pull me down. <br>
I don't care anymore. <br>
All my progress is gone. <br>
I don't care anymore. <br>
How would others feel? <br>
I don't care anymore.

I only care about one thing. <br>
Ending my life, <br>
the fastest way I know how.
