title: Glass Cage
---

I can’t get out. <br>
I can’t get in. <br>
The air is thin.

Out I look and all is there. <br>
In I look and it looks back. <br>
Staring through the crack.

There is no way out and no way in. <br>
No way to shout and no way to grin. <br>
For me at least.

In my head they shout. <br>
In my head they want out.

Shout and yell, <br>
Run about and tell,

Well.

Like birds they drop. <br>
The glass did stop.

Out they can shout <br>
Out they can’t go.

Inwards, outwards the result is the same. <br>
Inwards, outwards nothing came. <br>
The glass is what keeps you sane.

Keep the glass up. <br>
Dont break through. <br>
This is right.

That's what it said. <br>
What do I know? <br>
The cage stays up.
