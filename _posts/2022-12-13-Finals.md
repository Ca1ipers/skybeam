Doing work, wanting a break, I put down my pen.


I take a glance outside at the snowflakes drifting drearily. <br>
The gentle notes of piano from my headphones end eerily.

A deafening silence fills my ears as I slouch in my chair. <br>
Even if this is the end, how much more can I really bare?<br>
After this is all said and done, what else is there?<br>

I’ve done it before and I can do it again, but I’m tired.<br>
Everytime I finish a class, my brain is rewired.<br>
All these topics I once liked, now feeling uninspired.<br>
Feels like my times of wishful thinking have expired.<br>

When did I develop this fear?<br>
Why have I begun shedding a tear?<br>
Where did it all go this year?<br>
Who made everything into a smear?<br>
What would happen if I stopped right here?<br>

If my semicolon becomes a period, what then?
