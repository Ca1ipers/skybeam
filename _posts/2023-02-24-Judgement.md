Oh I hate this. <br>
Oh this is shit. <br>
That is garbage. <br>
That is bad.

I hear these too often. <br>
It’s like as soon as everyone hits 18 they become insufferable. <br>
Why is it that everyone in college has to have some kinda rage?

Name 3 bands! <br>
Name 3 animes! <br>
Name 3 games!

Why don’t you name me 3 times you respected someone else. <br>
Fine, you don’t like this thing. <br>
I fucking get it. <br>
But you don’t hear me talking trash about all your favorite things.

IF YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND THEN LEAVE IT THERE. <br>
DON’T KEEP BERATING IT AS IF THAT WILL SOMEHOW BAKE IT BETTER. <br>
DIRECT YOUR ANGER TO SOMETHING MORE MEANINGFUL.

It's like if I like anything I'm instantly placed in a stereotype. <br>
People don’t have the fucking brain to think for themselves. <br>
So they use stereotypes to make up for the brain cells they lack.

Fuck off.
