title: Economics of Worth
---

What am I worth to you?<br>
What’s the value of me?<br>
What’s my ROI to you?<br>
What do you think of me?

I’m a plain person with no passions or particularity.<br>
Nothing neat about this soon to be NEET.<br>
You’ll say something comforting or insulting.<br>
And I’ll choose to believe or deny.

I wish that's the way things were.<br>
I wish it was that simple.<br>
I wish it was enough.<br>
I wish that’s how it works.

I’m a jaded jobless joker with no justification.<br>
I’ve got no bills for these bills.<br>
You’ll say something hopeful or depressing.<br>
And I might just remain silent.

The economics of worth in humanity.<br>
They don’t work the way I wished it be.<br>
What am I worth,<br>
If it seems like I don't have any?
