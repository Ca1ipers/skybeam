I’m stuck in limbo, <br>
my arms akimbo, <br>
Akin to times where I couldn’t decide <br>
These sides of me are the part that I hate. <br>

Stubborn and stuck and standing still <br>
But my mind just keeps commanding till <br>
I envision a precision decision. <br>
But then there’s collisions causing divisions and incisions <br>
Because I lack the provisions seen on the television. <br>

Do I really have what it takes? <br>
It takes what I really do have. <br>
But its two halves of the same whole. <br>
One refuses but the other chooses, abuses, and accuses.

Enough with the word play. <br>
It’s been a blurred day. <br>
Because I just can’t decide. <br>
Flip, flop, flip, flop, drip, drop <br>
Time is passing and the answer must come.
