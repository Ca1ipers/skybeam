title: Ready or Not

A cycle of nothing <br>
A cycle of something <br>
A cycle of not wanting <br>
To do anything <br>
Anymore.

They said to aim for the stars. <br>
They said to not fly too close to the sun. <br>
Well I did both but I still missed and got burnt.

How can I capture my dreams with a broken net? <br>
How can I pay for my passions when I’m in debt? <br>
How can I do what I love when everythings a threat? <br>
How can I go on? <br>
Anymore.

Just sitting here with all this doubt. <br>
Even with this route in front of me, <br>
It just won't come to me.

Well I’m here already. <br>
Even with hands unsteady <br>
My legs so heavy <br>
And arms so sweaty. <br>
Let’s hope for confetti. <br>
Get ready.
