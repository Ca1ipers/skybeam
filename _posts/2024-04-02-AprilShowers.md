title: April Showers

These April showers wash me away. <br>
They pour down day after day. <br>
I wake up with fog in my head. <br>
So I just go right back to bed.

This April feels gloomier than most. <br>
I wake up and just eat toast. <br>
I’m skipping too many classes. <br>
I just blend into the masses.

The shower is colder than usual. <br>
I watch the water slide down my skin. <br>
Folds of fat and ingrown hairs galore. <br>
It’s been like this forever.

Will it be like this forever?

I stare forever into the screen. <br>
Work that’s piled up. <br>
Poems I haven’t written. <br>
Hobbies I left behind.

I can’t do any of it.

These April showers drench me in rain. <br>
This April feels hopeless. <br>
The shower is dry. 

When will it be over?
