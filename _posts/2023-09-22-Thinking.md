I know I can do it. <br>
I know they will let me. <br>
I know I just need to say something. <br>
But I just can’t.

I just can’t do it. <br>
I don’t know why. <br>
I wish I knew why. <br>
I need to know why.

I need to know why, even with all this support, <br>
Why is it that I’m still this way? <br>
I know I can’t rush getting better, <br>
I know a lot of things actually.

But you’d think after a decade of fighting I’d eventually come to a conclusion right? <br>
But you’d think after all these times I’ve felt down I’d figure something out right? <br>
But you’d think after every suicidal moment I’ve had I would have done something right? <br>
But you’d think after fighting myself over, and over, and over again, I’d know, right? <br>
But you’d think after feeling so alone so many times, I’d start talking right?

But that’s not the case.

I want to rip everything apart. <br>
My skin so I’d never feel ugly <br>
My brain so I could yell at it and ask why. <br>
My hair so it could never look bad. <br>
My eyes so I’d never have to see myself. <br>
My arms so I can’t tie a knot. <br>
My legs so I can’t run away.

I don’t want any of them anymore. <br>
I don’t want myself anymore. <br>
I don’t want anything at all. <br>
I don’t even want to die.

I just don’t want to exist.

Leave me forgotten. <br>
Until my body is rotten.
