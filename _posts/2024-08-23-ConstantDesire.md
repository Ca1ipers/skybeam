I just wanna say my goodbyes. <br>
Sometimes I wish I had just died. <br>
falling to my knees. <br>
Wishing time would freeze. <br>
and that I'd never even existed at all.

I want to disappear <br>
without a glance at the rear <br>
and I'd leave everything behind

but it's all unrealistic. <br>
my dreams are all mystic <br>
I'm stuck to the tracks of time.

I just feel left out all alone. <br>
Sometimes I think I'm unknown. <br>
with my head in my hands <br>
My tears fall to the sand <br>
and I didn't feel happy at all.

I want to call it quits <br>
just tear it all to bits. <br>
and leave nothing left to find.

leave me in your memories <br>
keep me as a story to tell. <br>
as I watch the hands drag me to hell.
