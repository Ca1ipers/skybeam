title: this morning.

I woke up this morning.

I don’t know how the next few will go. <br>
I don’t know how long I’ll be around.

I don’t want to do this anymore. <br>
I’m tired of everything life has to offer. <br>
It offers me pain and no rewards.

There’s no sense of relief. <br>
I finish one thing and then the next one comes. <br>
At this point I’m going to finish life. <br>
Hope the next one comes better.

You say dark comes with the light. <br>
But with so much darkness does the light even matter? <br>
I’ll just stay in the darkness, I don’t need false hope. <br>
I don’t need more memories. <br>
I’ll lose them all soon.

My dreams became nightmares <br>
My love became nihility <br>
There’s not much left for me to lose. <br>
My will to live is gone. <br>
My worries are fading. <br>
The only thing left is my life.
