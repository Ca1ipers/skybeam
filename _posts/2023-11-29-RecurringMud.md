title: Recurring Mud
---

The torrential rain creates mud beneath my feet. <br>
The same rain muddles my thoughts and mind. <br>
The mud sticks to the bottoms of my shoes. <br>
The same rain pounds my head and blasts my ears.

Every step I take, more mud gets stuck. <br>
I scrape it off and muddle forwards. <br>
Every thought I have, more of my brain is muddled. <br>
I wave it away, forgiving and forgetting.

Forgive and forget so much that’s all I know. <br>
Forgive the problems and they go away. <br>
Forget the pain and they go away. <br>
Forgive and forget me, let us all have a happy ending.

I say as if that’s what anyone wants. <br>
So why is it such a common thought? <br>
So why is it recurring so often? <br>
Commonly thought to be true, so it recurs.
