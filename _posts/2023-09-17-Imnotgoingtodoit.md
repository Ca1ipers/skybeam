title: I'm not going to do it.
---
When you tell me everything is going to be okay, how can I believe that? <br> 
When everything is going so fine, but my mind just keeps going out of whack. <br>
You tell me I just gotta keep going, I gotta push through, but I’ve done that all already. <br>
These phrases of encouragement and empathy just feel so meaningless.

Can you really say you know how that feels when you're not me? <br>
Can you really say it’ll get better when you’re not god? <br>
Can you really say to keep going when you’re not here? <br>
It's not like they haven’t been in places like this before, I know that. <br>
But my heart doesn’t understand and it keeps crying.

You could give me love, affection, and a heart made of gold. <br>
But somehow all I can feel is the immense cold. <br>
Is this depression? Or is this worse? <br>
I can’t even tell anymore.

Everything is fine yet somehow I’m not. <br>
Everything is happy yet somehow I’m not. <br>
Everything is pretty yet somehow I’m not. <br>
How is it possible to be surrounded by the best and still feel like shit? <br>
I’m fucking tired of all this but it doesn’t go away.

Can you tell me everything is going to be okay, even if I don’t believe you? <br>
Can you tell me that you love and care, even if I don’t believe you? <br>
Can you tell me that I have to keep going, even if I don’t believe you? <br>
My heart keeps crying but this at least keeps it distracted. <br>
