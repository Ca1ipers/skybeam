title: Memories Moments Before
---
You're locked in and I'm locked out. <br>
Everything makes me want to scream and shout. <br>
So I go back to the edge of the ledge, <br>
the ledge that I pledged or at least alleged, <br>
that I'd never jump.

And so when I trip and fall, <br>
before could jump off at all, <br>
what memories would I recall? <br>
Would I ignore the memories and take the leap? <br>
Would I break down into tears and just weep?

You’re moving on and I’m moving out. <br>
Gone with no legacy and no clout. <br>
So I grab the gun from my box, <br>
I load it up, removing the locks. <br>
I watch as the hammer cocks.

And so when the hammer slams, <br>
but the gun jams, <br>
do you think I'd still give a damn? <br>
Will I rerack the slide and give it another try? <br>
Will I empty the mag and just start to cry?

You’re standing up but I’m standing down. <br>
In the mirror, reflections of a clown. <br>
So I swallow every pill I know, <br>
It’s a death that comes slow, <br>
and with it, a throe.

And so when I’m woken by sunshine, <br>
Feeling completely fine, <br>
Do you think I'd take it as a sign? <br>
Should I down the pills once more? <br>
Should I give up and lie on the floor?
