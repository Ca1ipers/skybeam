title: It repeats.
---

I can’t say that I will kill myself. <br>
But I can’t say that I don’t want to die either. <br>
I said the pattern would end there, <br>
But by definition, they repeat. <br>
So here we are again.

I know the waves of depression ebbs and flows, <br>
But I guess I wasn’t ready this time, I don’t know <br>
what really comes after all of it? <br>
After all is said and done, <br>
Is there any way to alter it?

Can I take back my words and we can stay friends? <br>
Can I do better, and see the world through a different lens? <br>
Maybe in a parallel universe I’d be content with my life. <br>
It’s all just wishful thinking, there’s no such thing. <br>
The only way to improve life is to get through strife.

But I’ve been through enough of it. <br>
Sure there’s time to rest but I know best. <br>
And what's best is being happy. <br>
I don’t need stress to see the good in the world. <br>
It’s not a silver lining if the lining is just shiny plastic.

Yeah you can break me and repair me with gold, <br>
But I don’t want any cracks in the first place. <br>
I just want to be whole and happy and not fixed up. <br>
I don’t want pills to be happy, but I don’t want to suffer. <br>
I’ll take the damn pills, just drown me in drugs. <br>
I’ll take every single one of them “accidentally” <br>
And then maybe something will happen.

Maybe I’ll die.
