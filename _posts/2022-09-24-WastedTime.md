title: Wasted Time
---

Empty, blank. <br>
My heart and my brain. <br>
My life has slowly gone down the drain. <br>
Into the depths, off the plank. <br>

Tick, tock, <br>
And the sand falls down. <br>
Slowly but surely, I start to drown. <br>
My mind begins to mock. <br>

Well, well. <br>
Where has the time gone? <br>
Your life is so boring, I must yawn! <br>
From within I start to yell. <br>

Stop, stop! <br>
I say in a huff. <br>
I have tried my best, stop being so rough. <br>
Off the edge, I will drop. <br>

All the time I threw away, <br>
Every night, every day, <br>
No matter what I say, <br>
My mind just goes astray, <br>
As I slowly decay <br>
Replaying every play, <br>
It is trying to weigh, <br>
If what I did today, <br>

If it was really enough. <br>
