Zeros and Ones, that's what we do. <br>
It's what we do because it's simple. <br>
One or the other, how hard can it be? <br>

How hard? Its fucking impossible. <br>
I donâ€™t want to be one or the other. <br>
I want to be both and neither and inbetween. <br>

But my brain won't accept it because I can't look the part. <br>
The pudge and the smudge, <br>
the specks and flecks, <br>
the everything. <br>

Everything is wrong and nothing is right. <br>
What was once a simple question, <br>
Is now a dimension of pain. <br>

I know people of my size on both sides exist. <br>
I know I don't have to look a certain way to be it. <br>
I know what I need to do to change. <br>

And yet I sit still. <br>
Just gaining more. <br>
More weight. <br>
Both emotional and physical. <br>
