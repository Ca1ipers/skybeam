title: Someone to Love
---

I’m cold. <br>
Your hugs are so warm. <br>
Your words are so warm. <br>
It's so warm it’s scary. <br>
Scary that I still feel cold.

I’m selfish. <br>
I want your attention <br>
I want your validation. <br>
Validate me so I’m not scared. <br>
Scared that I don’t belong.

I’m sad. <br>
My rainclouds won’t go away. <br>
My shadows won’t go away. <br>
The shadows that scare me. <br>
Scaring me into thinking I deserve nothing.

Just forget about me and stay happy. <br>
You can live without me and still be fine. <br>
I don’t want to be a burden. <br>
Even if you tell me I’m not.

Why do I feel cold when your love is so warm? <br>
Why do I feel selfish when your love is directed to me? <br>
Why do I feel sad when your love is making me happy?

I want someone to pull me into their arms and never let go. <br>
I don’t want to feel cold anymore.

I want someone to scratch my hair and tell me I belong. <br>
I don’t want to feel selfish anymore.

I want someone to cry my tears into and feel better. <br>
I don’t want to be sad anymore.

Even if you did all that, I don’t know if I could stay.
