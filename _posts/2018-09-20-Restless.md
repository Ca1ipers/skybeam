Thoughts race around inside my head. <br>
Things about the world, <br>
things about being dead. <br>
Remembering the past, <br>
doing the present, <br>
and planning the future. <br>
So many inner voices, <br>
all a cacophony, <br>
of meaningless noise. <br>
They crash into each other, <br>
my mind starts to blur. <br>
The past, present, and future, <br>
all a smudge. <br>
In the infinite racetrack, <br>
that I call my brain.
