title: Leave Me Alone
---

They won't make it stop. <br>
Please make it stop. <br>
I can't make it stop. <br>
Can anyone even make it stop? <br>

The same thoughts bash my head. <br>

Think about the future! <br>
What about the future? <br>
WILL YOU MAKE IT? <br>

Think about the past! <br>
What about the past? <br>
DO YOU REMEMBER? <br>

no more. <br>
leave me alone. <br>
please. <br>

CAN YOU DO YOU WILL YOU ARE YOU <br>
