title: Nothing New.
---

Another day and there's nothing new. <br>
Another day and the gap grows wider. <br>
Another day and my thoughts get louder.

I stare into space while I walk around <br>
I stare into my reflection on every surface. <br>
I stare into the screen, words jumbling.

It’s all the same <br>
It’s always the same. <br>
It’s never not been the same.

Even when it’s not. <br>
Even when it’s entirely new. <br>
Even when it’s something I love.

I wish I didn’t think like this. <br>
I wish I was more normal. <br>
I wish I just knew what to do.

I know I can get better. <br>
I know I have plans. <br>
I know I can’t die.

But the voices get noisy <br>
But the urges get stronger. <br>
But the feelings get worse.

I want to do this. <br>
I can't do this. <br>
I won’t do this.

If only these emotions didn’t take me over. <br>
Over these past few days, it's gotten worse. <br>
Worse than it was last year I started. <br>
I started to talk, but I won't let me. <br>
Let me be what I want. <br>
But what I want, I’ll never be.
