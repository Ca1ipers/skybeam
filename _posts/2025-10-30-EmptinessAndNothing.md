title: Emptiness and Nothing

City lights seep through the blinds. <br>
My room is dimly lit. <br>
Neurons fire inside my mind. <br>
My thoughts won't quit.

It's the night before an exam. <br>
.I've woken up and fallen asleep a thousand times, <br>
You'd think I'd be better at this by now. <br>
But all I do is stare at the ceiling. <br>
But all I do is bear all these feelings. <br>
But all I do is ponder these meanings, <br>
and yet all I do, <br>
it all feels like nothing.

It's nothing because it's a hole in my heart. <br>
It's nothing because it's a gap in my brain. <br>
It's nothing because it's a blank in my gun. <br>
It's nothing because there's nothing there, <br>
but oh how I wish it wasn't.
