There are so many stars in the sky. <br>
Thousands, millions, billions, too many to count. <br>
All shining so bright.

Every star is different. <br>
Some brighter, <br>
Some bigger.

People see all the stars and are amazed. <br>
But they only ever think about the general population. <br>
No star is appreciated individually.

With so many stars, <br>
many way brighter and bigger, <br>
who would notice one fade away?

It tried to show signs of dying, but no one noticed. <br>
It expanded to be bigger and brighter but no one noticed. <br>
But when it finally dies, everyone notices it.

The star is gone, but who would care? <br>
The night sky is still beautiful. <br>
No one really needed the star. <br>
No one really cared about the star. <br>
It just faded away, <br>
away from the sky, <br>
and from everyone's memory.
