I wake up, and I’m feeling fine. <br>
It’s still there. <br>
I enjoy eating breakfast. <br>
It’s still there. <br>
Classes go smoothly. <br>
It’s still there. <br>
Playing games is relaxing. <br>
It’s still there. <br>
My friends are amazing. <br>
It’s still there. <br>
The bed is so warm and cozy. <br>
It’s still there. <br>

Out of all the things to come and go, <br>
In between everything I’ll ever know, <br>
Through all the sunshine and all the snow, <br>
It’s still there. <br>
Why? <br>
