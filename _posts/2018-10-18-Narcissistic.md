Am I a narcissist? <br>
Thinking that people should talk to me. <br>
Thinking that people should care about me. <br>
Thinking that I should be the most important friend. <br>

Always needing attention, <br>
but seizing up when I get too much. <br>
I'm not important. <br>
I don't deserve attention. <br>
I don't deserve anything.

What have I done to deserve love? <br>
What have I done to deserve my strange feelings? <br>
What have I done to deserve anything?
