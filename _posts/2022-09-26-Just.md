I’m just kinda sad. <br>
Nothing particularly bad. <br>
But skies are gray <br>
And I don't know what to say. <br>

I’m just depressed. <br>
I would never have guessed. <br>
That times would get this dark. <br>
I wonder if I’ve left my mark. <br>

I’m just suicidal. <br>
The world turns while I sit idle. <br>
I don’t really want to commit. <br>
But that's just it. <br>

Lost my motivation. <br>
The train has left the station. <br>
Hanging onto a thread <br>
Wishing I was deceased. <br>
