title: Mistakes
---

As I write this poem, <br>
mistakes were made. <br>
Messy writing here, <br>
a misspelling there, <br>
all gone with the wind. <br>
With my trusty eraser always with me, mistakes are nothing more, <br>
than some rubber shreds. <br>

But life is a pen. <br>
Everything is permanent. <br>
Whiteout may help, but underneath lies the secrets. <br>
The bad, <br>
the horrible, <br>
unable to be erased. <br>
It's burned into your memory, <br>
coming back to haunt only you. <br>

As life goes on, these mistakes lock you to the past. <br>
They won't let you continue. <br>
But they are just weights. <br>
You pull through them, <br>
no matter how many or heavy, <br>
you keep going. <br>
The only fuel is in your mind. <br>
That things will get better, <br>
that you will find the key, <br>
to finally be free. <br>
