Enjoying the breeze, <br>
It flies to your hand. <br>
A nice taxi to somewhere grand. <br>
It makes you sneeze. <br>
It invades, it infects. <br>
Not only the lungs, but the mind as well. <br>
How do you fight something so intangible? <br>

The corruption, panic, and the virus. <br>
Every cough, another feet apart people stand. <br>
Every roll, people fight for. <br>
Farther apart, people are getting more. <br>
The elderly, getting more and more sore. <br>
People just keep going past the door, <br>
Saying, "Oh I can endure." <br>
NO YOU CAN NOT. <br>

You will be the reason your grandparents rot. <br>
You will be the reason some people are forgot. <br>
You will be the reason people's hearts are tied into knots. <br>
Playing around, having parties and whatnot. <br>
You will be the reason, that people become invisible. <br>
