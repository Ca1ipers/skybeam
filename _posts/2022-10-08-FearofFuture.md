title: Fear of Future
---

Not really sure what to write about. <br>
Sometimes I want to scream and shout. <br>
Get it all out, get it all done, <br>
But even then the battle is not won. <br>

I usually go with the flow, <br>
But the stream’s kinda rough, so I don’t know <br>
Whether I should stay or go. <br>
Don't let it show. <br>

Even if I want to stay, <br>
The days will just go away. <br>
And it's not like there's anything here. <br>
The only reason I want to stay is due to fear. <br>

I don't want tomorrow to come, <br>
I don’t want these memories to fade. <br>
I don’t want to feel numb. <br>
I don’t want to see my grade. <br>

It's funny because I don’t want to leave, <br>
But good things will also never arrive. <br>
I wish I could skip all the bad and just breathe. <br>

I want to live. <br>
I want to thrive. <br>
I want to survive. <br>
