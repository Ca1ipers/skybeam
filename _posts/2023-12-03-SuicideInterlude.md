title: Suicide Interlude
---

Looking over the edge once more.<br>
Is any ending preferable than the other?<br>
The path where I die, and the other where I live.<br>
The path where I step away, and the other where I jump.

I filled my brain with mind melting music to distract myself.<br>
BUt tonight I took my earbuds out.<br>
I listened to the birds chirp in the early morning.<br>
And the sound of rain hitting the ground around me.

Every day that I’ve missed, every choice that I’ve made,<br>
Every question I’ve asked, and every sight that I’ve seen.<br>
Is this where it culminates?

Is this how I die?<br>
Not honorably, virtuously, nor memorably.<br>
Just a pitiful person perusing parking.

Pathetically partaking in this particular path.<br>
For someone so suicidal you sure do hesitate a lot.

I suppose that’s a good thing.<br>
There is a part of me that wants to stay.

I can’t find that part of me.

But I guess I’ll listen to it for today.
