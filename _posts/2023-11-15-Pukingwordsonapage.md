title: Puking words on a page.

I scratch and scrape at my arms. <br>
Nothing will ever make them disappear. <br>
I just want to rip them all off. <br>
All these little bumps and hairs, they’re stuck on my appendages.

I wish I didn’t have skin, I wish I didn't have hair. <br>
I try so hard for them, every day, to care. <br>
Doesn’t matter what product or formula I use, the result is always the same. <br>
All these little bumps and hairs, they’re stuck on my appendages.

Why do I have to care? <br>
Why do I even care? <br>
Not my problem, not my business, <br>
I used to not even notice.

Just take it all off, take it all away. <br>
I don’t want it anymore. <br>
I won’t do it myself, I can’t do it myself. <br>
So someone just please save the day.

Am I really talking about my skin? <br>
Or is this an allegory for something else? <br>
Who fucking cares and who fucking knows. <br>
I just want tears on the page, and not on my clothes.

I cried for the first time in a while. <br>
While walking around, could barely keep a smile. <br>
I got back to my room, and I could feel the bile. <br>
I puked words on a page, the contents: vile.
