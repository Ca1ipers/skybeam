They’re jumbled in a mess and I don’t know why. <br>
They talk to me and their voice sounds so fried. <br>
Maybe they cried.

I want to offer help but I could never understand. <br>
A silly little joke is all I can ever muster man. <br>
And so I scan.

I search my brain for solutions that might help. <br>
Maybe place them on the right belt. <br>
A conveyor to feeling better.

Nothing really works and they need some time alone. <br>
Sitting on my bed scrolling through my phone, <br>
I wonder.

Why is it that nothing ever comes out? <br>
Why is it that my feelings are so blank? <br>
Why is it that I never know what to say?

I go through many things day after day, <br>
But the thoughts never come, to my dismay. <br>
I just wanted to become a sunshine ray.

I hope they’re okay.
