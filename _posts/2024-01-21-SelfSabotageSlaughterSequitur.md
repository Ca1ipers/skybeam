title: Self Sabotage/Slaughter Sequitur
---
I said that I’d tell someone. <br>
I said that I’d talk about it when you’re not here. <br>
But that was never really the case.

I’ve always kept away, kept to myself. <br>
Didn’t really matter how bad things got. <br>
I’m sorry for lying to you.

You’ve always given me advice, given me tips. <br>
Ways to better my life and think differently. <br>
They never really went into use.

I kept my same solitary self inside my room. <br>
Everyday I stay in the same positions, doing the same things. <br>
I’m sorry I do this to myself.

I took the pills to feel better, <br>
But I only feel better when I’m not on the path I chose. <br>
Would any other path make me feel any different?

All I’ve done my whole life is self sabotage. <br>
I don’t do the things I need or should. <br>
I’m sorry that this is the way things are.

I’m sorry that all I can feel is bad about myself. <br>
I’m sorry that all I do is nothing particularly productive. <br>
There are many sequiturs to be made from this.

But there is only one that I keep thinking of.
