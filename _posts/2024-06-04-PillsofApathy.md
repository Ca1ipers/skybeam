title: Pills of Apathy
---
The abatement of my apathy is something I long for. <br>
I took pills and a swig at the end of the day. <br>
My mother never approved but it didn’t stop me. <br>
Who knew it would be the pills that stopped myself.

They never worked. <br>
Not 1 pill nor 2, I’ve already reached the limit. <br>
What’s next is addons and alternatives. <br>
Which I’ll never fucking get.

I’m tired of it all. <br>
I’m tired of this psychology. <br>
I’m tired of figuring out every little feeling that I get. <br>
I’m tired of it all.

I want to disappear and start all over. <br>
It wouldn't be the first time. <br>
I hope it’s the last. <br>
That’s if I do.

Will you?
