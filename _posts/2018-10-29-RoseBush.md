title: Rose Bush
---

A rose bush grows in a field. <br>
It's beautiful, vibrant, red flowers, <br>
smooth green leaves, <br>
they lure people closer. <br>

Underneath the beauty lies thorns. <br>
They stab people's backs, <br>
and deter everyone away. <br>
People know to avoid the rose bush now. <br>
The rose bush has no one. <br>
No one acknowledges it's beauty any longer. <br>
They all know what lies underneath. <br>

Until someone notices the bush again. <br>
They know how to fix it. <br>
They trim the thorns, and plant other bushes nearby. <br>
The bush is not alone. <br>
It has friends and a caretaker. <br>

It's thorns no longer destroy the garden of imagination. <br>
Instead it blossoms. Expanding it far past infinity. <br>
People love the rose bush again. <br>

It seems that everything is fine. <br>
But if you look past the heaven, <br>
you can see the hell. <br>
The rose bush was only a facade of what truly lies behind it. <br>

Plants are thirsty, leaves are rotting. <br>
But all attention goes to the roses. <br>
No one cared for the other flowers. <br>
They weren't beautiful enough. <br>
