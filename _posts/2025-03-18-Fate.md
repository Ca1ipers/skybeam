Do you believe in fate? <br>
A path destined for each of us. <br>
Wouldn't it be nice to know what’s in store? <br>
But knowing ruins the surprise. <br>
And knowing changes fate.

Fate can never be known, except in hindsight. <br>
But fate, I’d like to know. <br>
For once, let me know. <br>
Please, let me know. <br>
What else is there for me?

Maybe now’s not the time for me. <br>
Maybe later’s better than now. <br>
Maybe it only happens later. <br>
I don’t know if I have until later. <br>
How long must I hold out for?

The rain showers, spreading a static of drops across the street. <br>
Humidity fills the air, the vapours dampen my skin. <br>
My face ripples in the reflections of the rain. <br>
Is everything really fate and coincidences? <br>
Fate is fragile, and coincidences are capricious.

I wish I knew what was next. <br>
Because I feel like there isn’t. <br>
I think of alternate universes. <br>
All of those me’s. <br>
But they wouldn’t be, right?
