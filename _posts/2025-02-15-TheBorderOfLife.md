title: The Border of life

The bamboo flute announces my arrival, <br>
The symphony of strings lowers me gently.<br>
Lanterns fly into the mist, the sky covered in scrolls of memories.<br>
I trace the steps of so many others before me.<br>

The final journey, at the border of life.<br>
I step onto the vessel and ask the bargeman to proceed.<br>
Large drums thump somberly with every row.<br>
The ripples in the water reflect the stars above.

Each star shows every year, <br>
Every month,<br>
Every week,<br>
Every day,<br>
Every hour,<br>
Every minute,<br>
Every second.<br>
Every thing.

Everything I’ve ever known, seen, and loved.<br>
The mist turns to rain as the memories weep.<br>
Their drawings wavering, the sky of scrolls roll to a close.<br>
The vessel is parked, and ahead is the final gateway.

“Live in life, die in death.” The bargeman states.<br>
I pause and my muscles stiffen.<br>
The bargeman speaks once more:<br>
“To die, is to let go. A lingering ember remains.”

He steps towards me and wipes a tear from my eye.<br>
A tear that I unknowingly shed.<br>
“No one is waiting for you here yet.”<br>
“In fact, people are waiting from whence you came.”

The symphony of strings lifts me gently into the sky.<br>
Drums roar to life, with a whirlwind of flames and butterflies.<br>
Bamboo flutes wish me goodbye and good luck.<br>
I take one last glance at the bargeman below.<br>
“Every story will have its ending, please do not rush.”
