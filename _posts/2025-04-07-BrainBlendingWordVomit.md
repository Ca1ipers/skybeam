title: Brain Blending Word vomit
---
Heart empty. <br> 
Head empty. <br>
All of those words you said to me. <br>
Fell through me. <br>
Brain is fogged, with all of this smog, <br>
I just feel like a log.

Crashing out. <br>
Heading out. <br>
All while still filled with doubt. <br>
Self doubt. <br>
Got work to do, I’m running on fumes, <br>
I smell like a shoe.

Haven’t showered in weeks. <br>
But got places to be. <br>
I got hours of sleep. <br>
But it's nothing to me. <br>
Red on my cheeks. <br>
But not on my sheets.

Everything I say is nonsensical. <br>
Aiming with no reticle. <br>
For a major so chemical. <br>
These rhymes are skeptical <br>
My feelings, ephemeral. <br>
Poetical.
