title: Grayscale Destruction
---
Black, white, and gray. <br> 
That’s all the colours I see today. <br>
Monochromatic, I’m just an addict, <br>
To everything that makes life worth living.

My passion, undefined, <br>
My tastes, so unrefined, <br>
My sight, just colourblind. <br>
It’s no wonder I can’t get anywhere.

Can someone so plain reach the stars in the sky? <br>
Will the constellations above direct their life? <br>
Can someone so lost reach the distant cosmos? <br>
Will the stars go supernova and birth passion in him?

I try to see the colours in the sky, but it’s all monochromatic. <br>
I slack off on all my work, it’s getting problematic. <br>
The way I’ve deconstructed myself, It’s cinematic.

It’s like experiencing a car crash in slow motion. <br>
I feel the pain as every shard of metal and glass punctures me. <br>
The airbags deploy and explode, bruising my skin. <br>
My eyes have no choice but to watch as the destruction surrounds me. <br>
As the car wraps around a pole.

Black, white, and gray. <br>
That’s all the colours I can see today. <br>
Lying on the floor, wasting my life away. <br>
As I watch the light and colours decay.
