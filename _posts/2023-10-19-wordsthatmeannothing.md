title: words that mean nothing
---

I let the pain rain and radiate as I wander. <br>
The water turns the ground to mud, sticking to my shoes. <br>
I can’t feel the difference between the rain and my own sweat. <br>
Alone again, alone as always, alone all the time.

In this huge world, where could I be? <br>
In what place could I fit in? <br>
It’s all just a punishment for all my sins. <br>
Always so selfish and always so desperate.

It’s like I’m fighting against a mime. <br>
Creating so many fake or invisible walls. <br>
Stopping me from doing what I want. <br>
I know what I need to do, so why don’t I just do it already?

Just wandering in the world that I chose. <br>
Just rambling with words that have no meaning. <br>
Just sticking to all the same routines. <br>
Just yelling the thoughts that constantly come.

Arguing fictional situations and tendencies. <br>
Is it all just my fault? <br>
That's the easiest conclusion to come to. <br>
Forgive and forget, just move on.

I hope you meet the me that has their shit together. <br>
I hope you meet the me that isn’t alone so often. <br>
I hope you meet the me that isn’t overdramatic. <br>
I hope you meet the me that can understand their thoughts. <br>
I hope you meet the me that is better than I am now. <br>
I hope you meet the me that is able to stop themselves. <br>
I hope you meet the me that doesn’t have any scars. <br>
I hope you meet the me that is still alive.

I hope so too.
