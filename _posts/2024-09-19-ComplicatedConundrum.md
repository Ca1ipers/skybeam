title: Complicated Conundrum
layout: post
---
Staring at the sky watching the leaves blow by.<br>
Just wondering why I am still even alive.<br>
It’s not like I want to die, no that’s not it.<br>

It’s just that everyday I wake up and I feel like shit.<br>
It’s just that everything I learn I don't like one bit.<br>
It’s just that everyone is better and I want to quit.

I can’t move on.

I keep taking everything too personally.<br>
Every little comment it's like they’re hating on me.<br>
I wish I stopped feeling this way<br>
But my feelings are sensitive.<br>
I got all this love that I just want to give.<br>
And maybe then I’ll believe that I just want to live.<br>
It’s not just as simple as suicide.
