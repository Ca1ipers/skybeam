Why is it that I couldn’t have been small? <br>
I hate it. <br>
I hate it. <br>
I hate it all.

Every glance at the mirror on the wall, <br>
I hate it. <br>
I hate it. <br>
I hate it all.

I wish I could rip everything out. <br>
Skin. <br>
Nerves. <br>
Blood. <br>
Tearing it apart until I can’t shout.

I want to paint it all over. <br>
With skin. <br>
With nerves. <br>
With blood. <br>
Splatter it across my room. <br>
Create art that can never be replicated. <br>
A scene no one could forget.

One last glance at the mirror on my wall.

I can change. <br>
I know I can change. <br>
But then why is it that I don’t? <br>
Why is it so hard everytime I try? <br>
Nothing is ever enough for me. <br>
I guess it’s time to die.
