title: Sunk Cost Fallacy
---
I'm too far in to ever get out. <br>
Stuck in the repercussions of my own bad decisions. <br>
Every step I take, I lose even more passion.

Is it wrong to not be like others? <br>
The others who have a fire in their heart? <br>
They talk to professors, go to meetings, and get internships.

I just want to get by. <br>
I just want to get through. <br>
I just want to get it over with.

Even if I could change course, I don't have the funds for that. <br>
It's not like much would change. <br>
As soon as a hobby becomes a job it's no longer fun.

My life is the definition of a sunk cost fallacy.
