title: Light Headed Loneliness
---
I’m so light headed I might hit the ceiling. <br>
I'm so apathetic and I miss just feeling. <br>
But then the feeling hits and I find myself reeling. <br>
Apathy is just where I was meant to be.

I see them together and it hurts my heart. <br>
I had the very same love from the start <br>
But then I threw it away with all my teasing. <br>
Now I find myself constantly pleasing.

Chasing cares from people who don’t. <br>
I should just stop but I just won’t <br>
I have other people that I care for, <br>
So why do I keep going back, begging for more?

I’m so light headed so I’m going to sleep <br>
You won't hear from me, not one more peep. <br>
I’ll keep it inside where no one can see. <br>
At the end of it all, it’s always just been me.
