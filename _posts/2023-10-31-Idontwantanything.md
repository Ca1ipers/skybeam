title: I don't want anything.
---

I don’t want to sleep. <br>
I don’t want to wake up. <br>
I don’t want to do anything <br>
I don’t want to do nothing. <br>

I sit in silence but I fill my brain with toxins. <br>
Mindlessly scrolling, rotting in my room. <br>
Unable to move or do anything productive. <br>
If I stopped, I don’t know what would happen.

I don’t want to die. <br>
I don’t want to live. <br>
I don’t want to feel. <br>
I don’t want to kneel.

No answer makes me happy. <br>
So I just suffer for the time being. <br>
I don't want to just take the pain. <br>
But really, is there anything I can even do?

I don’t want to be alone <br>
I don't want to be together. <br>
I don't want to see. <br>
I don’t want to be blind.

I know what’s going on. <br>
I don’t want to be left out. <br>
But I know I’ll hate being with them. <br>
Even together I feel so alone.
