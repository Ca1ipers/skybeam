Sadness rains down on me. <br>
I run around looking for anything, <br>
something to stop the rain.

I run around through the fog. <br>
My vision is getting blurry, <br>
every step harder than the last. <br>
The weight on me getting heavier.

I found some towels, but they don't last. <br>
I find some shelter, <br>
but the wind blows it away.

The downfall of sadness only gets, <br>
worse, harder, and foggier. <br>
I keep running, fear my only fuel.

My tears add to the pouring of rain, <br>
increasing the pain, <br>
overwhelming the ball and chain, <br>
thoughts rush inside my brain, <br>
"I want to die, I want to die!" <br>
Until hopefully, <br>
eventually, <br>
I will. <br>
