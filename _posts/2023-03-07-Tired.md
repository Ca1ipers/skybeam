title: Tired
---
The moon is full, and so am I. <br>
Full of words, thoughts, and feelings. <br>
So I put my pen to the page, <br>
Or, rather, my fingers to the keys, <br>
And I write something to relay these messages.

Words appear one after another. <br>
Words disappear one after another.

One after another, new thoughts push the line. <br>
There’s something within me that wants to write, <br>
But something within me keeps blending.

Blending the words, thoughts, and feelings. <br>
I can’t get a grip on what they say. <br>
They seep through my fingers.

I watch as it oozes off my hands, onto the floor. <br>
I stare for a while. <br>
I stand for a while.

I’m tired.
