title: I Don't Know
---
Do people love me? <br>
Does anyone have a crush on me? <br>
Am I enough for people? <br>
Am I good in school? <br>
Should I kill myself? <br>
How do I kill myself? <br>
What am I feeling? <br>
Why does everything hurt? <br>
Why is everything so hard? <br>
Is my work good? <br>
Are my poems good? <br>
Who am I? <br>
Who are my friends? <br>
So many questions, <br>
all with one. <br>
unsatisfying, <br>
short, <br>
answer. <br>
I don't know. <br>
And it hurts that I don't.
