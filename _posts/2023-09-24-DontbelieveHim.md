title: Don't believe Him
---
You know it’s not true but you keep spewing words out of your mouth. <br>
Every word that comes out of your mouth, I know it’s all lies. <br>
I know better than you. <br>
I know more than you.

Do you really know better? <br>
Do you really know more? <br>
How can you tell this isn’t just a gut feeling? <br>
Something that you were meant to do?

I don’t want to hide it from all my friends. <br>
I don’t want to keep it all inside. <br>
I know I’m not supposed to. <br>
But for some reason I still do.

I know it’s not true, but I listen to the words you spew from your mouth. <br>
Every word that comes out of your mouth, I take it in. <br>
Even though I know better. <br>
Even though I know more.

I know it’s not true but somehow I still believe you.
