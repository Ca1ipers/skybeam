title: A silent sweet goodbye
---

If only we could just have a silent sweet goodbye.<br>
A goodbye that wouldn’t hurt.<br>
A goodbye that would be simple.<br>
A goodbye that would give everyone closure.

As much as I’d like to stay, I have to go.<br>
There’s nothing else for me here.<br>
They said they wanted fighters,<br>
But I’m just not up to it anymore.

I just want a silent sweet goodbye.<br>
Goodbye to everything that ever happened.<br>
Goodbye to anything that ever bothered me.<br>
Goodbye to all that ever cared for me.

Painless, discrete, and fulfilling.<br>
I’m not sending a message.<br>
I just want to sleep for a long while.<br>
I’ll be yours forever, inside your heart.

One final silent sweet goodbye.<br>
Let your feelings fly beyond the celestial cage.<br>
Let memories of me swim to the constellations above.<br>
Let me go.
