title: Counting Down
---

5 is the number that is my favorite. <br>
It has been since I was little. <br>
Children have little worries, but I had many. <br>
I was depressed from all the change. <br>
I was scared of death.

4 is the number of death. <br>
Pronounced similarly in many languages. <br>
Common number of lines for my poems. <br>
I think you can connect the dots.

3 is the number of weeks. <br>
I need to last at least that much longer. <br>
Scratching, scraping, it burns.

2 is the number of moles in Oxygen gas. <br>
I canâ€™t breathe.

One.
