title: Personalities
---

Many different personalities, <br>
crafted specially for each class or person. <br>
So many different personas, <br>
lined up in a row. <br>
Every new person may require a new one. <br>
I create one based on their interests, <br>
and quickly seal it up. <br>
My collection is getting too full. <br>
I slip and the shelf falls down. <br>
All these personalities mix together, <br>
and I start to feel numb. <br>
Not knowing how to feel, <br>
how to think. <br>
My mind races to fix what broke, <br>
but it doesn't know how. <br>
It no longer has the knowledge. <br>
A blank slate. <br>
Only able to perform certain functions. <br>
A robot in human skin. <br>
Overheating, <br>
Memory corrupted, <br>
System 32 has been deleted, <br>
All these random topics and feelings, <br>
mushed together in a poem. <br>
What do I do? <br>
What do I know? <br>
Nothing. <br>
