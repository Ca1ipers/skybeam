There it is. <br>
That empty feeling. <br>
Feeling like that's all there is.

I realize now that it's the reason. <br>
The reason why I stopped experiencing these kinds of things. <br>
Visual novels, anime, even stories in general.

They start and they end. <br>
And when they end, so do I. <br>
The happiness fades away, and I'm left with emptiness.

I forgot how lonely it gets. <br>
I forgot how sad it gets. <br>
I forgot how much is wrong with me.


That's why I never finish anything. <br>
Always leaving something left. <br>
Something to keep my mind away. <br>
My mind away from the thoughts that pile up.

But it's over now. <br> 
And so will many things. <br>
I don't think I'm ready.
