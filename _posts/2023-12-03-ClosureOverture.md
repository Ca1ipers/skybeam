title: Closure Overture
---

The mist of a freshly rained city covers the tops of the tallest buildings. <br>
Lights shine the fog ahead, creating clouds of light that shine brightly. <br>
Small puddles of rain litter the streets, reflecting every sight I see. <br>
Cold air tickles my cheek as I walk up the steps of the parking deck. <br>

Every car that I pass by, an entire life filled with memories and sorrow. <br>
I hear the cars still awake drive by, sending a rush of wind my way. <br>
Wind carries the water droplets and mist which dampen my clothes. <br>
The quiet conversations of those still awake echo through the parking deck. <br>

The stars actually don’t shine bright tonight. <br>
I look up at the sky, gray and cloud covered. <br>
I look down at the street, dark and puddle littered. <br>
Will you really do this to yourself tonight?

Tonight I went up to the parking deck. <br>
The parking deck where someone died. <br>
Died from jumping off the top. <br>
The top is where I am.

I am 3 weeks away from winter break. <br>
I stand here, my entire life at stake. <br>
I feel the wind brush past. <br>
Will you do this at last?

I am 2 steps away from the rails. <br>
I don’t want to get near. <br>
The universe where my urge prevails, <br>
Is the universe where I have no fear.

I have one last question for you.

Is it okay if I’m scared?
