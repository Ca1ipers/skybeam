title: Wanting to see
---

My eyes gaze beyond the horizon, yet I can not see what will come. <br>
The farther I look, it simply becomes the past. <br>
However, even the past is fading away now. <br>
As time passes, more is lost, and the less I see. <br>
But that’s not what I want.

I want to see the universe as intended. <br>
I want to see the places, worlds, and galaxies beyond our reach. <br>
I want to see grand green forests and the rays of sun that peek through the treetops. <br>
I want to see cavernous hills with caves that stretch into the darkest depths. <br>
I want to see high rises scratch the clouds as rain covers everything in a gloss of water. <br>
I want to see large lakes of water, calm as can be with a surface smoother than glass.

I want to see myself there.

This blurs the line between reality and rose tinted glasses. <br>
Are these places somewhere I can really go? <br>
Or are they delusions of the past and future? <br>
Whether the flags are green or red it won’t matter. <br>
When it comes to all of this, I’m colourblind.

I don’t want to see what the universe plans. <br>
I don’t want to see the places, worlds, and galaxies I can’t reach. <br>
I don’t want to see depressing dark forests and the glowing embers of fire that remain. <br>
I don’t want to see cavernous hills with mines deep, scraping for every ore. <br>
I don’t want to see high rises block the sun as garbage litters the ground around me. <br>
I don’t want to see enormous lakes of water rage and thunder against the shores.

I don’t want to see it happen.
