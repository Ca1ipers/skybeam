title: A beautiful cruel world.

A forest embedded in darkness.<br>
Only a highway that cuts through.<br>
Speeding down the road<br>
I became one with a tree.

Snow covered plains.<br>
Only faint footsteps remain.<br>
Taking a final step.<br>
My body was perfectly preserved.

An ocean, clear and deep.<br>
Darkness below me.<br>
I start to sink.<br>
I was never found.

One day this will be a memory.<br>
And one day I’ll forget about you.<br>
One day I’ll get how much you meant to me.<br>
And one day I’ll wonder how the world is so cruel.
