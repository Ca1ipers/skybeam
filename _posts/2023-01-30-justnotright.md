title: just not right.

It's just not right. <br>
It's just not there. <br>
I reach into my head and all is bare. <br>

I don't wanna fight. <br>
I don’t wanna think. <br>
Into these feelings I will sink. <br>

Any more and I just might. <br>
Any more and I just will. <br>
Going past the line, and in for the kill. <br>

Myself tells me to look for the light. <br>
Myself tells me to look for the dark. <br>
Why would I trust myself when myself can’t make a mark? <br>

NOTHING IS REAL <br>
NOTHING I CAN FEEL <br>
TO NOTHING I WILL KNEEL <br>
FOR NOTHING IS ALL I KNOW <br>
INTO NOTHING IS WHERE I’LL GO. <br>
