It's just not right.

It's just not there.

I reach into my head and all is bare.


I don't wanna fight.

I don’t wanna think.

Into these feelings I will sink.


Any more and I just might.

Any more and I just will.

Going past the line, and in for the kill.


Myself tells me to look for the light.

Myself tells me to look for the dark.

Why would I trust myself when myself can’t make a mark?


NOTHING IS REAL

NOTHING I CAN FEEL

TO NOTHING I WILL KNEEL

FOR NOTHING IS ALL I KNOW

INTO NOTHING IS WHERE I’LL GO.
