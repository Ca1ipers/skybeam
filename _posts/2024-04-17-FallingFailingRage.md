title: Falling Failing Rage
---
Falling down the stairs at supersonic speed, <br>
I hit every step, not a moment to breathe,<br>
I look at how far I’ve fallen and all I can do is grieve.

How have I gotten this far, but also nowhere at all?<br>
How have I learned so much, but also fail to recall?

My poem writing shit, I don't like it one bit<br>
But I need these feelings out of me<br>
So i put the pedal to the metal,<br>
And my pen to the page,<br>
Writing with nothing but unbridled rage,

Just angry that I wont do shit.<br>
Mad that I just want to quit.<br>
It’s never that hard,
But it's never that easy.<br>
But I always get it done.<br>
So why do I feel queasy?

Just type words on a screen,<br>
That's how it’s always been,<br>
But then in my dreams I scream,<br>
And I rip through the seams,<br>
To see the streams,<br>
They all lead to one path.

Two weeks remain.
