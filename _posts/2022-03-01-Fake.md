Everyone has the occasional white lie. <br>
“It looks great!” <br>
“That's a nice tie!” <br>
“Yeah I washed the plate.” <br>

But when it comes to me, <br>
It is impossible to not see <br>
The white lies that surround me. <br>

Fake <br>
Fake <br>
Fake <br>
They say it for your sake. <br>

They don’t really mean it. <br>
Your stuff looks like shit. <br>
They don’t like it one bit. <br>
That’s it. <br>
