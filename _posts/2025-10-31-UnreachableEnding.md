I can wish a thousand wishes, <br>
I could think a million thoughts, <br>
I can hope for a billion things, <br>
and none of it would come true.

never happy. <br>
never satisfied. <br>
never enough.

I'm never escaping this loop. <br>
I'm a rat in its wheel. <br>
I'm a pig chasing a carrot on a stick. <br>
I'm a kid finding the end of a rainbow.

What's left for me? <br>
don't answer that. <br>
I don't want to know. <br>
I don't want to find out. <br>
I don't want to sleep. <br>
so I don't have to wake up. <br>
Goodnight.
