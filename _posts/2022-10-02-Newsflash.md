The sky is blue and so are my tears. <br>
Been feeling the same over all these years. <br>
Hard to believe that I even got this far <br>
While feelin all these feelins but I guess thats par <br>

Par for the course of life. <br>
Happiness mixed with a little strife. <br>
But who really knows what par is? <br>
I dont even know where the bar is. <br>
Just a nobody to most bodies<br>
I’m gettin real tired of all of these <br>

Mixed signals inside of my brain. <br>
Every little mistake another stain <br>
“Oh but its a learning opportunity” <br>
Not to the community. <br>
Do the wrong thing and its mutiny. <br>
Every little thing under their scrutiny. <br>

They think at your age you should know <br>
Even though they dont let it show <br>
The methods in which they used to grow <br>
Its all mistakes. <br>
NEWSFLASH! <br>
Nobody’s perfect! <br>
Throw that mindset into the trash. <br>
Take a gash <br>
Make a splash <br>
Fake some cash <br>
Okay maybe not that one, but you get the point. <br>
Its okay to have some problems, now lets bust this joint. <br>
