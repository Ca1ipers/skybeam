title: I don't want to remember.

I don’t want to remember. <br> 
I don’t want to remember every mistake I’ve made.<br>
I don’t want to remember the inconveniences I’ve caused.<br>
I keep fighting but they keep getting up.<br>
I keep forgiving but they keep getting angry.

I don’t want to remember.<br>
I don’t want to remember that I’m sad.<br>
I don’t want to remember that I’m anxious.<br>
I keep distracting but it keeps coming through.<br>
I keep focusing, but it keeps coming up.

I don’t want to remember.<br>
I don’t want to remember the plans I’ve made.<br>
I don’t want to remember what it’s like.<br>
I keep going on, but it keeps bringing me down.<br>
I keep backing up, but it keeps bringing me away.

I don’t want to remember because I know I’m better.<br>
I don’t want to remember because I know I’ve changed.<br>
I don’t want to remember because I know I learned.

I don’t want to remember because I might actually do it.
