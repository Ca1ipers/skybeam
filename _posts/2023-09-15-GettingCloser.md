title: Getting Closer.
---

If I knew it would end someday, maybe I wouldn’t take things lightly. <br>
Maybe I wouldn’t consider ending my life so often. <br>
Because if I want to kill myself so much, does this life even have any meaning? <br>
I already struggle to find it, what I’m supposed to be, what I’m meant to do. <br>
I just stay on this path because it's the one I chose, yet I get no feeling.

I wish you would just accept my tears for what they are and nothing more. <br>
I don’t need worse thoughts when I’m already letting it all out. <br>
That is if you even let me, always holding it in and shutting it out.

You don’t say anything but somehow my ears hurt from all the noise. <br>
Even the deepest parts of my heart and soul ache but nothing is happening. <br>
There is complete silence and tranquility yet I writhe on the ground.

These ideations of so-called “happiness” are getting annoying. <br>
So uselessly deep or overly simple, just some words that don’t serve a purpose. <br>
The anger stems from the relation of me to these words of joy. <br>
I’m not happy, but I am useless.

What value does a life that wants to end have? <br>
In the end I’ll regret it, so I guess there is none anywhere anyways. <br>
In a lifetime of sulking and regrets all I wanted was some love and warmth. <br>
It’s not like I never had any, but I guess just like everything else with me, <br>
It’s never enough.

Selfishness in both suicide and needs, thats everything to it. <br>
Either way the balance favours one side over the other. <br>
I don’t know how it still hangs on to be honest. <br>
I bet you’re confused, and so am I. <br>
I wish I could explain this to you better. <br>
I wish I could explain this to myself better.
