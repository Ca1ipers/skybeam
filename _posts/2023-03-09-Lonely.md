title: Lonely.
---

A lifeboat swaying in the vast ocean. <br>
My throat is parched beyond belief. <br>
Dehydrated, my vision glitches and flashes. <br>

I can’t tell if it’s night or day. <br>
I can’t tell if it's all gonna be okay. <br>
I can’t tell if the land is close or far away.

Pulsing, radiating, my brain undulates in my skull. <br>
Resonating, reverberating, my body oscillates. <br>
Uncontrollably, I hurl.

Not the same letters as before, just actual vomit. <br>
Right into the worldwide toilet we call the sea. <br>
Plastic, chemicals, wastewater, you name it.

It’s funny, this cycle of toxin consumption and release. <br>
Whether it be media, sustenance, or opinions. <br>
This cycle doesn’t end.

A lifeboat swaying in the vast ocean. <br>
My mind is parched beyond belief. <br>
Alone, my psyche glitches and flashes.

I’m lonely.
