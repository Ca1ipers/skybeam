title: A poem cut short.
---

A run on sentence. <br>
That’s what it feels like. <br>
It goes on for too long, and ends weirdly. <br>
Today has gone on for too long, and is ending weirdly.

A blinker left on. <br>
That’s what it feels like. <br>
The car could be turning, or maybe the car forgot. <br>
I could be turning, or maybe I forgot.

A leftover forgotten in the fridge. <br>
That’s what it feels like. <br>
Cold, alone, and maybe even rotting. <br>
I’m cold, alone, and probably rotting.

A normal, functioning human being. <br>
I don’t know what that feels like.
