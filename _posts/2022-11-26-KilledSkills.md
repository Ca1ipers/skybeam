title: Killed Skills
---

The granite and ivory keys reflect the glare that I give. <br>
What was a minor problem is a major headache. <br>
Trying to sift through my brain like a sieve, <br>
To find the skills I had long forgotten. <br>

The language is spoken to me but all I do is stare. <br>
Wǒ bù zhīdào and j'essaie de me souvenir, <br>
But everything in my mind comes up bare. <br>
Failing to recall the expertise I once had. <br>

Problems are laid out on the table. <br>
The most integral part, and where pain was derived. <br>
I am now simply unable. <br>
To solve the puzzles I formerly knew. <br>

Where did the time go? <br>
To where did my knowledge flow? <br>
Why won’t it come back to me? <br>
How much must I plead? <br>

Do not plead, for the fault is of your own. <br>
Practiced these skills, and you would have known. <br>
But due to your own ignorance and lack of ambition, <br>
You have now failed your mission. <br>
