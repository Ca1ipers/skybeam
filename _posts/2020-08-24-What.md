What's this feeling in my heart? <br>
I don't even know where to start. <br>
Taking laps like in Mario Kart, <br>
I'm going in circles. <br>

It's even in my brain, <br>
the feelings I'm trying to contain, <br>
to stay sane, <br>
all this pain, <br>
I'm not even sure if I can feel it anymore. <br>

Have I gone numb? <br>
Have I gone dumb? <br>
When put up to it, <br>
does anything I've ever done even mean shit? <br>
I'm having a fit. <br>

Or maybe I'm just overreacting. <br>
Its a sad thing, <br>
to see such potential, <br>
become so differential. <br>
