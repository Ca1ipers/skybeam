title: Empty.

A hole in the chest and a hole in the brain. <br>
Missing pieces lost.

Traverse the lands where they were sprinkled. <br>
Nowhere and everywhere.

Feelings fleeting, flying like dust and time. <br>
Around and back again.

Holes in the brain and holes in the chest. <br>
Made by bullets of words. <br>
For the best? <br>
just rest.

I'm empty. <br>
