Feeling kinda bleh, <br>
Feeling kinda meh. <br>
Feeling kinda bad but not really sad. <br>

Everything’s pretty okay, <br>
Everything’s pretty gray, <br>
Everything’s pretty down, and I think I’ll drown. <br>

In this strange feeling of nothing. <br>
I say I’m good but I’m bluffing. <br>
I say I’m good but I’m huffing. <br>
In this strange feeling of nothing. <br>

This experience is temporary, <br>
But may be a cautionary, <br>
Of things unordinary, <br>
Although momentary, <br>
It’s a feeling that something’s not right. <br>
