title: Meandering
---
I opened my mouth but had nothing to say. <br>
I wanted to say goodbye. <br>
But I knew they'd see me later. <br>
I grip and I grasp and I gasp but nothing's there. <br>

Every second I've spent. <br>
Every dollar that's passed. <br>
I can't help but feel like I'm draining. <br>
What's left if no one's there?

I closed my eyes but sleep never came. <br>
A circadian rhythm that's off beat. <br>
An orchestra with no conductor. <br>
Nihilistic viewpoints saturate my spaces.

Overthinking, Overspending, Overreacting. <br>
That's all it is. <br>
At least I hope it is. <br>
See you soon.
