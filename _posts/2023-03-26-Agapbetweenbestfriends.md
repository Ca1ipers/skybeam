title: A gap between best friends
---
Remember the gap I can never bridge? <br>
Well this one is like that but it's with friends I'm closer to. <br>
This gap appeared recently. <br>
And I don't know what to do about it.

I feel disconnected. <br>
I feel disconcerted <br>
I feel dissociated.

Like there is a gap between me and my best friends. <br>
Like there is something that still separates us. <br>
Like there is something I can't get over.

I guess it's because I can't really ever vent to anyone. <br>
I say I will and they say I can. <br>
But I never take advantage of it. <br>
I guess it's because my feelings are too complex. <br>
And that's what these poems are for.

But what happens when my feelings are so complex that a poem is not enough? <br>
But what happens when the poems I write deteriorate into rants? <br>
Are they even poems anymore? <br>
Are they even feelings?
