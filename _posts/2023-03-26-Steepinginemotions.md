title: Steeping in emotions
---
My heart hurts but I cannot cry. <br>
Like a pump that's running dry. <br>
Who knew that it could go so awry.

Just wanting to listen to a good story. <br>
But it ripped my guts and became gory. <br>
Broke out a war and achieved no glory.

I want so much and I want nothing all at the same time. <br>
Why am I so confusing. <br>
That didn't rhyme.

Because I'm tired. <br>
Or at least I wish I was. <br>
Somehow I'm wired.

I wish I was tired, then I'd actually fall asleep. <br>
Can't feel sad, bad, or mad if you're unconscious. <br>
But instead I let my emotions steep.
