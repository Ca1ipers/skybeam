title: A realization
---
Pain radiates like waves within me. <br>
I didn't know that it could hurt so much. <br>
Wanting someone, needing something. <br>
I wish I had them all.

It makes it hard to sleep. <br>
For all my life I've always been brushing things off. <br>
Going with the flow. <br>
Now I realize why.

It was all just a defense mechanism. <br>
If I always went with everything then nothing is wrong. <br>
Nothing is bad. <br>
Nothing is mad.

It's the same reason I can't commit to things. <br>
I've never had to make my own hard decisions. <br>
So when it comes to finishing things I love, or even putting on a sticker. <br>
It's almost impossible.

The empty feeling in my chest grows and grows. <br>
I can do nothing but wallow in it. <br>
It gives a strange sense of something. <br>
Not quite comfort, but it's one I haven't felt in a while. <br>
So in a masochistic sense, I stay up and cry.

What is wrong with me.
