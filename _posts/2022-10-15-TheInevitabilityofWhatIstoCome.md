title: The Inevitability of What is to Come.
---

The crisp atmosphere of a winter twilight envelops me. <br>
A frigid breeze scrapes across my arms, leaving goosebumps behind. <br>
Enraged clouds emerge, they spark with flashes of light. <br>
Every step I take is illuminated with yet another burst from above. <br>
The flickering incandescence of lightning highlights my surroundings. <br>

I gaze around. <br>

An extensive field of blonde wheat sway vigorously with the gusts. <br>
Ahead, an immense, beaming celestial halo lowers through the exasperated clouds. <br>
They separate to promulgate the radiance of the ethereal halo. <br>
As it descends, a mist rolls in, enshrouding the once vast field of wheat. <br>
A clear path is created directly towards the halo, now hovering slightly above dirt. <br>

I start to sprint. <br>

My feet pound the earth, my arms swing from side to side, sweat flying off. <br>
I pant and I puff and I huff and I gasp, attempting to reach the halo. <br>
The wheat around me flails as I charge past it, every step a little crunch. <br>
Pebbles and soil fly behind me, as my charge forwards continues fiercely. <br>
Stamina is draining, health is depleting, running on empty, I soon find out. <br>

I lurch forwards. <br>

A mist of confusion dazes my brain, lagging behind my movements. <br>
Mental haze masks my call for action, my appendages feel lethargic. <br>
I trip over my own bare feet, tumbling to the ground in a cloud of dirt. <br>
Bruises speckled all over me, and blood starts pouring out. <br>
I attempt to drag myself along, clawing at the soil, gasping for air. <br>

I am too late. <br>
