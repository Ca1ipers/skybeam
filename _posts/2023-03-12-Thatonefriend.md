title: That one friend
---

I wish I knew. <br>
I wish I knew what was going on. <br>
I wish I knew how they really think about me. <br>

They say they appreciate me and my time. <br>
That I’m always there for them, <br>
And I’m always nice.

I sit here, waiting for responses. <br>
I sit here, waiting for an invite. <br>
I sit here, waiting.

It’s like I’m just thrown to the sidelines. <br>
Never the main or the first one. <br>
Just a backup person to go to.

I know I’m not their first friend. <br>
I know I’m not. <br>
I know I’m not that important.

Simply, it wouldn’t kill to respond on time. <br>
It wouldn’t kill to ask me to play every now and then. <br>
It wouldn’t kill to just give me some attention.

Empty promises, and empty notifications. <br>
It’s not as bad as I’m making it seem. <br>
But small things add up, <br>
And I’m fed up.
