There are questions I must answer. <br>
I reach inside my mind to find it. <br>
I feel nothing. <br>
Taking a look inside reveals the reason. <br>
My mind is blank. <br>
A monotonous whiteness, <br>
stretching near infinity. <br>
Where did everything go? <br>
I start walking in one direction, <br>
only to end in the same spot. <br>
What happened? <br>
Who am I? <br>
The silence pierces my ears. <br>
It hurts. <br>
Everything hurts. <br>
Even when there is nothing here, <br>
a radiating pain surges through my body. <br>
I felt blank, and numb. <br>
But now I feel it all.
