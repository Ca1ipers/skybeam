Maybe if I weren’t me, I would have a job. <br>
I’d pay for all my stuff, and give everyone gifts. <br>
I could travel the world, stand up on a cliff, <br>
And then maybe I’d be less of a slob.

Maybe if I weren’t me, I would make more friends. <br>
I’d go out of town, and have a good night. <br>
I could get help with my work, get everything right, <br>
And then maybe I’d see life through a new lens.

Maybe if I weren’t me, I would have passion. <br>
I’d make so many things, and get famous for that. <br>
I could get paid, and be proud of my flat.<br>
And then maybe I’d finally stop crashin. 

But If I weren’t me, then who would I be?<br>
I’d sit on the sand, gaze into the sea.<br>
I could lie here for days, rot on here to death.<br>
Until I took my final breath.

But if I want to live, then what should I do?<br>
I can't just make money out of the blue.<br>
I can’t just sit here and take in the view.

I just wish I was a better me.<br>
Whoever that is. <br>
Maybe we will never see.
