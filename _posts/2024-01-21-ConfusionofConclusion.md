title: Confusion of Conclusion
---
I don’t know where I’m going. <br>
I don’t know when it’ll end. <br>
I don’t know what I’m doing. <br>
That’s all I do know. <br>

I down a pill and take a drink <br>
I blast my music just so I can’t think. <br>
Back to square one since I missed my refill. <br>
But I don’t think I even left.

People are fleeting and so is my time. <br>
But I spend every moment on my own, inside. <br>
I just need to get out and go do more. <br>
I just need this, I just need that,

I think I just need to stop.

I stare into the mirror. <br>
I wonder who I am. <br>
I wonder who I’ll be. <br>
Every choice I’ve ever made, <br>
Every word I’ve ever said.

Was any of them ever right?

I could’ve continued my life at home. <br>
Where college wasn’t a cost, <br>
Where I would’ve graduated early.

What will I do and where will I go? <br>
I’ll never know.
