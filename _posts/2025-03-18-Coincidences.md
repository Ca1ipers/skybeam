title: Coincidences

Was it fate that we met? <br>
Was it a coincidence that we were there? <br>
At the same time, at the same place. <br>
I’m glad to have met you.

Was it a choice you made? <br>
Was it a decision I went with? <br>
The same thoughts, the same opinions. <br>
I’m happy to be with you.

So what if fate was different? <br>
So what if coincidences didn’t happen? <br>
Would our choices be the same? <br>
Would the decisions even matter?

So many coincidences brought me to you. <br>
So many choices brought me to you. <br>
And you to me.

It’s been a while since a coincidence has happened. <br>
I’ve been waiting for a while.

I hope you still remember me.
