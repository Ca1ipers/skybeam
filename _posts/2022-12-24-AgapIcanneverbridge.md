title: A gap I can never bridge
---

Between me and everyone I meet there is a gap. <br>

If we are closer, then the gap is smaller.<br>
Talking to them is a simple hop away.<br>

Problems arise when they introduce me to another.<br>
They are the one that bridges the gap.<br>
This can bring us closer, but the outcome is always the same.<br>

As soon as my friend leaves, the gap stays wide.<br>
As soon as they’re gone I feel the need to hide.<br>
As soon as they go our conversations die.<br>
As soon as my friend goes, my tongue is tied.<br>

Why is it that the gap remains so large?<br>
Why is it that I cannot take charge?<br>
Why is it that all the gap does is enlarge?<br>

I can’t take the stress so I stay silent.<br>
At some points it even feels like I am a burden.<br>

So I leave.<br>

Leaving the gap that I can never bridge.<br>
